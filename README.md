# FTP File Server via Socket Programming in Python

This was a file server written in Python 2.7, which makes use of Python's socket module. It enables the transfer of any file type, but it wasn't actually FTP.

All the packages used in this implementation are included in the standard library, which is why I picked it.

### Usage
